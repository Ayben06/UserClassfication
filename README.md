# Machine Learning for User Classification Project
## The Business Case

Machine learning’s numerous implications include improving business decision-making. This project provides a practical illustration of this use case. It focuses on predicting the likelihood of a student registered for a free plan purchasing a subscription on the platform. The decision is based on students’ activities on the platform—viewing lectures and participating in exams.

The project is inspired by an initiative in 2022 to predict student purchases before the Black Friday campaign. The project aims to create a list of students likelier to purchase and retarget them with unique ads on social media. But as it turned out, this was no easy task due to the extreme imbalance of the data—the number of students who had never purchased a subscription was much higher than the number of students who had. 

As you will see, such class imbalance combined with humans’ unpredictable behavior makes it challenging to predict student purchases.
